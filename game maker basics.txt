SPRITES:

Sprites are images. Everything that the player sees has a sprite associated with it.

OBJECTS:

Objects are the core of a game. They contain events, which look for some specific condition (such as the mouse button being
pressed) and actions, which are what the object does (such as move).

ROOMS:

Rooms are the levels of the game. You put objects in rooms in order to have the player interact with them.
